Help</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western">Link Translator is a tool that lets you easily
translate English Wikipedia hyperlinks into their German equivalents,
thereby replacing the text representation and the URL of the
hyperlink. It does this by using several sources of information:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">a
	built-in database, which is based on text files and can be edited by
	the user</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">the
	Wikidata service, which is Wikipedia's mechanism for generating the
	list of inter-language links on the left hand side of a topic</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">the
	Wikipedia topic pages themselves and their inter-language links.</FONT></FONT></P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">You
can interact with Link Translator in several ways, depending on your
preferred workflow. First you have to tell Link Translator the
original text you are working on and you can do that in several ways:</FONT></FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Open
	an OpenOffice document that contains the original (english) text</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Select
	text in OpenOffice or in Firefox (other web browsers have not been
	tested) and drag an drop the selection onto the Link Translator
	window</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Select
	text in OpenOffice or in your web browser, copy it to the windows
	clipboard (Ctrl-C) and the paste into the Link Translator window
	(select the Link Translator window and press Ctrl-V).</FONT></FONT></P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Link
Translator will extract all the hyperlinks from your input, translate
them and then present the result in its main window, link by link.
You can move back and forth between the hyperlinks via the <I>previous
/ next</I> buttons.</FONT></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Working with Link Translator</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Opening an OpenOffice Document</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Link Translator offers several alternatives for
your workflow while working on a translation. One is to read a
complete OpenOffice document and extract all its hyperlinks in a
single operation. You do that by <I>File -&gt; </I><I>Translate Links
in OpenOffice Document&hellip;</I>. (As an alternative you can also
drag the file name from an Explorer window into the dialog.)</P>
<P CLASS="western">Then you can browse through those hyperlinks with
the <I>previous</I> / <I>next</I> buttons and see their suggested
translations. You can edit the German translation or URI of a
hyperlink if you don't like the suggestion. After you are done with
your editing you can either</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">append all translated hyperlinks to the
	opened document, where you can pick them up later when your are
	working in your OpenOffice document, or</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">drag and drop one link at a time from the
	Link Translator window into an OpenOffice document or other
	applications and insert them at their final position in your
	translation document.</P>
</UL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Using Drag and Drop</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Sometimes you want to just translate a single
hyperlink or a small number of them. The most convenient method for
this scenario is to select them in your web browser or in OpenOffice
and drag them onto the Link Translator window. In this case Link
Translator will translate your hyperlinks and you can look at them as
usual with the <FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><I>previous
/ next</I></FONT></FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">buttons.
Note however that you will not be able to append the translations to
an OpenOffice document. Instead you can start a new drag in the Link
Translator window and drag the translation to your OpenOffice window
or another application. Thereby you can place the translation
precisely where you want them to be.</FONT></FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Using Copy and Paste</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Very similar to the Drag and Drop method is using
Copy and Paste. Instead of draging some text containing hyperlinks
onto the Link Translator window you copy the text in the source
application (either by using a menu command or by the Ctrl-C keyboard
shortcut) and then paste it to the Link Translator window (again
either via an menu command or via the Ctrl-V keyboard shortcut). And
much like in the Drag and Drop method you can now look at each
hyperlink and transfer the translations by another Copy-and-Paste
back to your document. While being in the Link Translator window
press Ctrl-C (or use the <I>Edit &rarr; Copy</I> menu command) then
go to your OpenOffice window and press Ctrl-V there to insert the
translated hyperlink.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Which of the three methods you use is totally up
to you and depends on your preferred workflow. You can even mix the
three methods, for example open an OpenOffice document with the
<I>Translate Links in OpenOffice Document &hellip; </I>button and
then move the translations over to your target document in a
one-by-one fashion by Drag and Drop.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Installation</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The installation of LinkTranslator is extremely
simple. Just unpack the zip-archive into a directory &ndash; that's
all. If you want to install LinkTranslater in a Windows-conformant
way this directory should be under the system's P<I>rogram Files</I>
folder (<I>Programme</I> in a German system). You will need
administrator rights to create and access a directory there. As an
alternative you can create a directory on any place where you have
write access from your normal user account and run LinkTranslator
from there.</P>
<P CLASS="western">LinkTranslator comes with two files that comprise
the translation database: <I>TransUrlDb.txt</I> and <I>TransTextDb.txt</I>.
These are simple text files that you can open in any text editor. As
LinkTranslator allows you to amend those files by more translation
rules these files must be write accessible to your normal user
account. As this might not be the case when you install under Program
Files LinkTranslator allows you to move these files to a different
directory. Go to <I>Tools &rarr; Configure&hellip;</I> to tell
LinkTranslator the folder you have put them to.</P>
